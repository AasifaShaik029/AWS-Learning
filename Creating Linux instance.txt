CLOUD NOTES
---------------
For windows we need RDP port(use remote desktop from your computer and give credentials and proceed)
For Linux we need SSH port

1.Download putty and puttygen
2.Generate ppk (Putty Private Key)file using puttygen(load pem file into puttygen)
Thru SSH Client
---------------------
3.Select ec2 instance, go to ssh  client and select ex domain/public ip address and paste 
ec2-user@ec2-65-2-161-154.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
4. Also select ppk file to putty and connect to linux server.
:)

Another way:
Thru Instance connect:
-------------------------
copy public ip and give as domain name in putty
and select ppk file and connect
:)
you can directly select ppk file while creating instance and follow same connecting method in putty.(not recommended)
cuz pem is usable in some cases(like vpc)
1ppk for 1insatnce





Basically public IP address is dynamic but we can change to static/elastic ip
